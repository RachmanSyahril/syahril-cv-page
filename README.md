# Hello, Welcome to My CV-Page

I haven't able to make my imagined ideal CV using any CV Maker out there, so I try to make one using HTML and CSS :D

Built in standard A4 paper using pure CSS + ReactJs via [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Feel free to clone this if you're interested :)

# Deploying to Github Pages
## 7. Push the React app to the GitHub repository

1. Push the React app to the GitHub repository

    ```shell
    $ npm run deploy
    ```

    > That will cause the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts defined in `package.json` to run.
    >
    > Under the hood, the `predeploy` script will build a distributable version of the React app and store it in a folder named `build`. Then, the `deploy` script will push the contents of that folder to a new commit on the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository, creating that branch if it doesn't already exist.

    > By default, the new commit on the `gh-pages` branch will have a commit message of "Updates". You can [specify a custom commit message](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/issues/80#issuecomment-1042449820) via the `-m` option, like this:
    > ```shell
    > $ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
    > ```

At this point, the GitHub repository contains a branch named `gh-pages`, which contains the files that make up the distributable version of the React app. However, we haven't configured GitHub Pages to _serve_ those files yet.
